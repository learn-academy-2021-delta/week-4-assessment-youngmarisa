# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props or properties is a keyword in React that is used for passing information, specifically data and methods, from a parent to a child component using a component call. Props can only be used unidirectionally meaning they cannot pass information from a child to a parent component. Props allow the user to interact with the information that is being displayed.  

  Researched answer: To pass information from one component to another in React, developers will used the keyword props or (properties). It is a way to pass the information from a parent to a child component using component calls. Most of the props in React come from the React state. React state is a way of updating data within components. Props come from state by passing on the components that display or let the user interact with the updated data within the components on the web browser.  Since react props are limited in functionality and can only send information in one direction, react functional props can be used to pass information from one component to another. Functions can be created in one component and called in another component; they can send information between components in either direction.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: DOM stands for document object model. DOM events track the user interactions on the web browser and is listening for any changes. For example, when a mouse is hovering over an item that can be clicked on the icon of the cursor will change from an arrow to a pointer hand. The DOM listens for any changes from the user and responds accordingly to the event.

  Researched answer: DOM events are listening for changes from user interactions on web applications. Developers want to create web applications that recognize these interactions and changes to respond accordingly. Even listener tags can be added to specifically listen for an event to occur. For example, the onClick button attribute can cause the DOM to listen for an event and execute an action, described by the developer, when the click event occurs.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: In object-oriented programming, everything is an object which allows small containers of data to be edited without having it affect the entirety of the program's code.

  Researched answer: OOP is a data or object based way of organizing code in programming. Ruby is an example of an OOP language. OOP uses objects to intersect data and behavior. Variables store the data information. Behavior are functions that belong to objects. Methods direct what objects should do as a response to a particular message. This differs from functional programming that organizes code around functions. Functional programming is a declarative style of programming. State doesn't change in functional programming.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: In Ruby, float and integer are two different data types. They both represent numbers however, float represents a non-whole number and an integer represents a whole number. For example, 5.0 is a float data type while 5 is a integer data type.

  Researched answer: Integers are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero. Float numbers in Ruby are non-whole numbers meaning they contain a decimal point. Float numbers can also be positive or negative.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Ruby has an implicit return meaning that it will return the last line of the method. In order for the method to be returned, it needs to have the Ruby keyword 'end' to explicitly define the end of the code block.

  Researched answer: In Ruby, every block of code will return the value of the last line of the method without the use of the 'return' keyword automatically.




## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: Instance variable is a non-static variable defined in a class. It is declared outside of the constructors, methods, and or code blocks but it still in the class. They are created when an object is instantiated.

2. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is an open sourced type of structured query language. It uses an object-relational database management system.

3. Ruby on Rails: Ruby on Rails uses the Ruby language for a server-side web application framework.

4. ORM: Object relational mapping uses OOP to convert data between incompatible systems.

5. Active Record: The interface between the database and Rails application is the active record. It is a Rails ORM. It takes data stored in a database table to allow you to interact with the data.
